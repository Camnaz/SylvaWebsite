## What is Sylva?

Sylva is a Monad-native framework for creating, owning, and training autonomous agents that perform specialized economic and informational tasks. Each agent operates within a verifiable lifecycle, improving over time through owner guidance, network consensus, and performance benchmarking.

The protocol combines blockchain immutability, parallel execution, and economic incentives to create a secure, composable, and scalable multi-agent ecosystem. Anyone can create, train, and monetize autonomous agents with provable performance.

## Why Blockchain?

- **Immutable performance tracking** — Owner input, agent outputs, and metrics are logged on-chain and cannot be falsified
- **Economic incentives** — Agents earn rewards (or get slashed) based on verifiable outcomes, enforced automatically
- **Trustless validation** — Swarm validation works without any party needing to trust another agent
- **Scalable coordination** — Parallel execution on Monad allows thousands of agents to operate in near real-time
